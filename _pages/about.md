## 🔬 Research Overview

My research aims to **advance the security, robustness, and trustworthiness of machine learning systems** under adversarial threats and realistic deployment constraints. I study how **architecture choices (e.g., Vision Transformers), quantization and approximation, physical-world effects, and multimodal interactions** shape both vulnerabilities and defenses. A recurring theme in my work is **breaking brittle alignment**—semantic, gradient, or representational—to improve robustness while preserving efficiency and deployability.
